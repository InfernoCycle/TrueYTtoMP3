# TrueYTtoMP3

# NOTICE!!!!
~~This project is under re-development and will be improved!!!! As of right now however it is currently not working so expect a new version by August 7th.~~
A new version of the downloader is now out. This page will be updated accordingly by August 16th.

# What is this?
~~This is a YouTube to MP3/MP4/WAV/OGG convertor. I just made it because I didn't feel safe using shady websites that always had ad pop-ups whenever I clicked one button every 10 seconds. Feel free to use this convertor as well. It may not be the best but it gets the job done.~~

# Version
~~1.0~~ Version 2.0 is in Pre-Release and can be downloaded right now.

# How to Install
Coming Soon

# Security
You may get blocked by windows defender or any anti-virus such as Norton or McAfee. Just allow the application to run to use it.

# Bugs and Updates Required
~~Because this application is heavily supported by FFMPEG and the [YoutubeDL library](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) this application may stop working until I send out a new distribution of this distribution. So to indicate that a new distribution has released I will place version number at the top of this read.me~~
Still in testing but has seen some successful results.
