# TrueYTtoMP3

# What is this?
This is a YouTube to MP3/MP4/WAV/OGG convertor. I just made it because I didn't feel safe using shady websites that always had ad pop-ups whenever I clicked one button every 10 seconds. Feel free to use this convertor as well. It may not be the best but it gets the job done.
