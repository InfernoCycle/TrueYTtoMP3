# TrueYTtoMP3

# What is this?
This is a YouTube to MP3/MP4/WAV/OGG convertor. I just made it because I didn't feel safe using shady websites that always had ad pop-ups whenever I clicked one button every 10 seconds. Feel free to use this convertor as well. It may not be the best but it gets the job done.

# Version
1.0

# How to Install
1. First Download the folder/files from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xkd6QZQocnWYIHb6Om-vRh5mvJPjeA7T?usp=drive_link) by clicking "bin" and then "download" as seen in the pic below.

4. Click and open the "bin" folder. It should contain 3 executables (ffmpeg, ffplay, and ffprobe). Now copy the full path of the "bin" directory. Example of path: "C:\<whatever path you have>\bin-20231027T220332Z-001\bin".
